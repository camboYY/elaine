          The speed of your Internet connection has an influence on the quality of the video stream. The live casino product is optimized to run on a broadband Internet connection so we do not recommend playing using a slower connection.<br/>
          If you are using a broadband connection but keep experiencing streaming issues, you can try to improve the quality of the video stream by closing other programs running in the background, reduce the screen resolution from the game´s menu, or resize your browser window to be smaller.

          In the unlikely event of a dealer error, gambling system or game procedure error, the game round will be temporarily paused while the dealer notifies the pit boss.<br/>
          You and other players will be notified via chat or by an on-screen pop-up message that the issue is being investigated. If the pit boss can immediately resolve the error, the game will continue as normal. If an immediate resolution is not possible, the game round will be cancelled and initial bets will be refunded.

You’ll be able to bet on American football, soccer, tennis, hockey, horse racing, greyhound racing, golf, boxing, basketball, baseball, and more. Name a sport and you can almost be guaranteed that there’s a sports betting company that will allow you to make a wager on it.
